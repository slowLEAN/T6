We loaded the Iris classification dataset and prepared it for machine learning by splitting it into training and test sets. We normalized the features using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally. We experimented with different values of K using KNeighborsClassifier, trained the model for each K, and recorded the accuracy on the test set to find the best K. We evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix, and visualized the results with a plot of accuracy versus K and a confusion matrix. Finally, we visualized the decision boundaries in 2D using the best K to understand how the model classifies data points based on two selected features.
